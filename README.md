# Instrument Tracking App 


"Hi all! This is my second project since joining Get Coding. I've created an Instrument Tracking App (SurgiTrack) using React.js." As an operating room nurse, I understand the importance of having the right surgical instruments at the right time. That's why I created this app to help myself and other healthcare professionals easily track, locate, and update surgical instruments.

The app is designed to save time and increase efficiency, which is crucial in the fast-paced environment of the operating room. I am constantly working to improve and update this app to meet the needs of healthcare professionals like myself. 

## Features

- Desktop and mobile-friendly app
- Navigation bar with Home and About pages
- Main container with Instrument Set and Single Instruments buttons
- Table with data, search bar for easy instrument/set finding, and pagination
- Instrument Set page with a dropdown menu to filter sets by specialty
- Mini modal that displays information and image when an instrument set is clicked
- Image zoom feature on hover
- Options to delete, modify, or create new items

## Development Status

Please note that the app's back-end is currently under development, so any changes made within the app won't be saved, and all data will be lost. However, the front-end is fully functional.

## Feedback and Contact

I welcome your feedback and suggestions on how I can make this app even better. Please feel free to contact me on my LinkedIn profile or here on GitHub.
