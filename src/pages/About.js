      <p>Hello and welcome to my surgical instrument tracking app! <br></br> As an operating room nurse, I understand the importance of having the right surgical instruments at the right time. That's why I created this app to help myself and other healthcare professionals more easily track, locate, and update surgical instruments.<br></br>

I know firsthand the challenges of keeping track of instruments during a surgery, which is why I designed this app to be as user-friendly and efficient as possible. This helps to save time and increase efficiency, which is crucial in the fast-paced environment of the operating room.

I'm constantly working to improve and update this app to meet the needs of healthcare professionals like myself. I welcome your feedback and suggestions on how I can make this app even better.</p>
